# Self-Modeling

This repository contains the code and environments used to create the results shown in the paper "A Self-Modeling Framework for 2D and 3D Articulated Arms"

Our code can be run with the following options:

```bash
python main.py --env [simple_arm_2d, simple_arm_3d] \ 
               --loop [open, closed] \
               --nb-epochs [epochs] \ 
               --nb-train-episodes [nb_train] \ 
               --nb-test-episodes [nb-test] \
               --show-model
```
